### How to Use the Program
#### Teachers:
First, they will have to go into the teacher page from the sign-in screen. The teacher access code is `teacher`. After the teacher is in the teacher page, they will be able to view the announcements that they have previously posted, or they will be able to create a new website. By default, the announcement will be sent to all students. However, the teacher can also send announcements to different grades, genders, or clubs. This is useful for when the teacher wants to send the announcement to a specific demographic. If the club they want to send it to is not available, or they are creating a new club, they can create a new club by pressing the New Club button.
#### Students:
Firstly, the student must go to the student settings page. There, they will be able to select their grade, gender, and club. Afterwards, they will be able to go to the student announcements page. They will be able to see all the announcements that are applicable to them.
